                There were a couple of issues that I faced with the code below.
                First, allPlayers is a static array and hence must only be accessed using Player class
                Second, this convenience initializer is not necessary. This can be done in the first initializer itself. This is an experimental use and in some way also to make the code more readable.
                Third, self.init does not work in the below case. That is because self.init results in a delegation and delegations cannot be done in expressions(assignment is an expression).
