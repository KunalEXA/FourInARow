    /*
        Following are the things I learned from below code
        1. Lazy properties always need an initializer. We cannot leave them declared and define them later.
        2. There are several ways to do this. One is chaining this with computed properties as done below. Like I have chained strategist with stragiestInstance.
        3. Another way would be to use some function to instantiate the value sometime later in the code...like on view did load or something.
        4. However both these options make use of self which has a strong reference. It might lead to a strong reference to itself.
            ViewController -> strategist -> strategistInstance -> ViewController.
            Need to check if this could be a problem later in the future.
        5. We can also use optionals to instantiate the items later.

         This code seems to work in a way similar to the one above. But it does not reset chipLayers array.
         It seems like this creates a temporary column array and then operates on it.
         It also makes sense because whenever we are modifying contents of an array they are copied first and then operated upon.
